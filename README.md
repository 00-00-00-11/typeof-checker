# Typeof Checker

A simple object typeof checking library.

Install the library using `npm i typeof-checker`.

**Warning: I haven't tested this too much with anything other than `typeof "string"` and `typeof "number"`. Create an ISSUE if you find any bugs!**

Check out the "examples" folder for usage. I tried to make it as common sense as possible.
